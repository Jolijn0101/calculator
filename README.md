## Description:

Like the title already suggest this project is a simplistic calculator. It can make various calculations.
See the features part of this README for more about the functions of the calculator. This project is made to add
to my portfolio as an frontend developer. Instead of using a tutorial for this calculator I started to code myself.
It was a fun and educational experience. I learnt a lot from it. One of the things that I learnt was to discribe for
myself how the project should look and work. After that I cut the project in to steps and followed them step by step.

## Feedback

Personally I think this calculator came out nicely altho there are a view things to improve.
I made a lot of eventhandlers in my HTML file and I wonder if I could code it another way.
The calculator could only be used by clicking on the numbers. In the future I hope I could
let it work also by typing.

Would be nice to learn from it.
